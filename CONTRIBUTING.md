# How to contribute
Contributions are essential for keeping NodaMoney great. It's impossible for us to be experts in every currency in each country,
so every help is appreciated. If you have a problem, a great idea or found a possible bug in NodaMoney, please report this to us
as an [Issue](https://github.com/remyvd/NodaMoney/issues).

Do you want to contribute with code changes, there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that your change
can be accepted quickly.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub (we use the [fork & pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests))
* We use as branching strategy the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
* Optionally you could install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/), a Chrome extension. This will add a task dashboard, file uploads
  and +1 (likes) to GitHub.

## Making Changes
* If possible, create an issue for big improvements or features, so that people can discuss.
* Make commits of logical units, so that we can pick and choose.
* Make sure your commit messages have a good description.
* Complies with StyleCop rules and Code Analysis (runs on Release configuration).
* Complies with Coding Codelines (see document in solution).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Push your changes to your fork of the repository.
* Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to the NodaMoney repository.
* If needed we will give feedback about the pull request or accept it right away.
